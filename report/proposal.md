# Project Description
## Problem Statement and Motivation
This should be a brief and self-contained decription of the problem that your project aims to solve and what motivated you to solve this problem.

As bioengineering students, we are passionate about the intersection of data science and healthcare. For this project, our particular interests surround the investigation of healthcare data to determine how variables including prevelance of disease, cause of death, and quality of care differ between geographical location and how we can predict healthcare outcomes using this information.  

## Introduction and Description of Data
 Why is this problem important? Why is it challenging? Introduce the motivations for the project question and how that question was defined through preliminary EDA.
 
Based on the current state of the world and the struggle to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, it is clear that improvements can be made to the healthcare system as a whole. Through the use of publicy available datasets, it is our goal to analyze information surrounding the general health and well-being of subjects in hopes to analyze how certain factors including early childhood, alchohol use, blood presure, access to care, etc. relate to overall health. Specifically we hope to investigate topics such as how access to health care and insurance is affected by occupation and income, how smoking or drug use may lead to other complications, and what may be some predictive indexes for people with heart disease. Following some EDA, we were able to find datasets through the Center for Disease Control and the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey that have much of this information available.  

# Plan
This could include the major timeline and milestones of your project as well as requirements of computing and storage resources. 

Total: 7 weeks to completion

Week 1: 
1. Source a data set(s) that give information regarding prevelance of disease, cause of death, and quality of care in reference to geograhpical location
2. Work to clean and compile the dataset 
      - Get rid of null values 
      - remove outliers
Weeks 2&3:
3. Analyze the data and determine best modes for visualization
4. Create visuals to communicate final insights from data analysis

Weeks 4-7:

5. Create predictive indexes for specific conditions (i.e diabetes, heart disease, etc)
6. Create website to showcase the final analysis and insights
